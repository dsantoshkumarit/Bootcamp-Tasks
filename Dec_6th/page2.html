                                    ACHIEVING an important milestone, the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) 
                                    technology developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation 
                                    (DRDO) has undergone trials between two laboratories in Hyderabad where the 
                                    quantum technology- based security was validated for a range of 12 km over a 
                                    fibre optic channel.

                                    <br>
                                    QKD is primarily a mechanism to undertake secure communication which utilises 
                                    a cryptographic protocol involving various components of quantum mechanics. The 
                                    technology enables two communicating sides to come up with random secret keys 
                                    shared by both of them and known exclusively to them, so only they can use it
                                     to encrypt and decrypt messages, thus achieving highly-secure communication.

                                    The technology has been developed by two DRDO facilities, 
                                    Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR), 
                                    Bengaluru, and DRDO Young Scientists’ Laboratory – Quantum 
                                    Technology (DYSL-QT), Mumbai.

                                    Defence Minister Rajnath Singh congratulated the DRDO team for
                                     successful demonstration of QKD communication. As part of a 
                                     successful trial, the technology was tested in real life conditions 
                                     and performed well on all parameters. As part of the test simulation, 
                                     an entity trying to gain access to communication was also detected by the system.

                                    DRDO scientists said that the work being done on QKD technology
                                     at DRDO will be used to enable start-ups and small and medium
                                      enterprises in the domain of quantum information technologies.

                                    Apple Inc. is planning a series of new Mac processors for introduction as early as 2021 that are aimed at outperforming Intel Corp.’s fastest.
                                    Chip engineers at the Cupertino, California-based technology giant are working on several successors to the M1 custom chip, Apple’s first Mac 
                                    main processor that debuted in November. If they live up to expectations, they 
                                    will significantly outpace the performance of the latest machines running Intel 
                                    chips, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because 
                                    the plans aren’t yet public.

                                     The company’s next series of chips, planned for release as early as the spring and 
                                     later in the fall, are destined to be placed across upgraded versions of the MacBook Pro,
                                      both entry-level and high-end iMac desktops, and later a new Mac Pro workstation, the people said.
