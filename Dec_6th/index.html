                                to the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), India’s 
                                drug regulator, seeking emergency use approval for their candidate 
                                Covid-19 vaccines which are still under trials. None of these has yet
                                 generated data about the effectiveness of their vaccine from phase-III 
                                 trials conducted in India, which is a mandatory requirement in the normal 
                                 process of approval.

                                 which the CDSCO will have to evaluate and decide on.
